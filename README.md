# Reactive Corona App ðŸ˜·

A web application for the Covid-19 status.

- Get the total number of active cases ( Infected , Deaths ).
- Get the Global status with respective timeline.
- Beautiful charts for daily cases.
- Can select different countries.
- Shows value for that country with charts.

#

### ðŸ›  Used ReactJS, CSS, ChartJS, MaterialUI, Hooks.

### âœ” Live Demo: https://reactive-corona.netlify.app/ 


#

### âš  Note: The Global Chart may not show because of some CORS restriction that I'm trying to solve. Also the recovered value may show 0 because the API is not providing that value right now! I'm searching for a better API.

Have Fun âœŒ
